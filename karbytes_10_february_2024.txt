Today while taking a light afternoon nap next to a large field full of short bright green grass and several large shallow puddles of water providing a refuge for Canadian geese, ground squirrels, and other wild animals, I temporarily experienced what felt like an "out of body experience" in the form of being in a partially asleep and dreaming state while, to some extent, "forgetting" where my body was located and what condition it was in. That experience was not anything I would classify as out of the ordinary for me (and I imagine such an experience is very commonplace amongst other humans). When I "returned" to what I currently consider to be my "baseline reality" (i.e. the hypothetical "root folder" of some potentially infinitely recursive succession of virtual realities "on top of" (i.e. substantiated by "relatively physical") virtual realities), I had a thought and feeling which I have had many times in the past but was experiencing with more prominence and a sense of "this might be worth writing about" creative compulsion: the "sense" that I am not an animal even while appearing to be just as much of an animal as the other animals residing in that field. Though I appear to have almost identical organs and genome to many other vertebrae animals (especially mammals), I cannot help but feel that the species of animal which refers to itself as human has effectively become an emergent (software(?)) property "on top of" its own physiological hardware. 

I feel that what I essentially am (i.e. the thing which generates what appears to itself to be its own words and abstract thoughts which seem to have the capacity to become at least as elaborate as the entire "baseline" universe which I live inside of (as in having the mental capacity to literally imagine and simulate entire universes and multiverses complete with their own governing laws of physics and computational logic and maybe even sentient inhabitants confined (at least temporarily) to such mental simulations)) is not a structure composed of atoms, but instead, some entirely virtual object which literally has no definite location in the universe where my physical body dwells but is, nevertheless, strongly connected to and interdependent with that physical body. 

A significant aspect of the website which I established within the past four years named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com is distilling my ontological beliefs; panpsychism in particular (and panpsychism is an assumption about reality that literally all phenomena (whether physical or virtual) are fundamentally confined to a single ubiquitous mind which dreams up any and all phenomena into existence (and I assume that it does so from multiple different perspectives simultaneously which may or may not be able to interact with each other in some kind of "multiplayer online game"-like inferface)).

As bold as this might sound (and arguably dangerous), I think that the aspect of existence which I differentiate from everything else as my own mind (i.e. myself in the most fundamental sense) is capable of being sustained without a physical body and for a limitlessly long "time" period (and from my first-person vantage there may be a sense of time always elapsing along some linear continuum despite that vantage flashing in and out of various simulations which each has its own space-time continuum). Such a claim is substantiated by the "axiomatic" premise that the whole of reality is unconditionally confined to a single boundless "field" of consciousness because such a premise implies that any physical, logical, or arbitrary cultural laws can be violated at any time; that deterministic causality is entirely imaginary and hence capable of being broken in limitlessly many unique and arbitrary ways such that literally anything goes (and the whole of nature is comprehensive enough to literally encompass every solipsistic and collective consciousness vantage without "canceling out" any other vantage by virtue of each vantage taking place in its own isolated "partition" of the all-encompassing multiverse which is nature itself).

I was staring at the geese and attentive to the fact that those animals seem so meticulously and artfully designed that I could imagine that a human like me coded up the designs for such creatures in some kind of universe simulation program which was set to run (inside of some relatively "baseline" universe which is parallel to that simulated universe which is an emergent property of that code being executed by some kind of information processing agent (and that simulated universe is the universe in which I am writing this note)). It could be the case that I (karbytes) already created the entire universe which I inhabit and that what I am now (i.e. the mind which is writing this note) is a digital clone of the karbytes which set the universe in which I am writing this note inside of into motion (and potentially forever and potentially without any substantiating "baseline" hardware after that simulated universe was instantiated out of pure nothingness as soon as the respective program began to be executed by some relatively "baseline" hardware computer), a literal continuation of the mind which created the simulation I inhabit now (and which no longer inhabits the "baseline" universe which set my current simulated reality into motion), or an entirely new mind which was not derived from any "parent" mind.

These are just some interesting philosophical ideas I thought my future selves and perhaps other sentient entities might appreciate reading about in the form of a plain-text journal entry which I link to my blogging website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).

ChatGPT-4 Summary of the text in the previous section of this plain-text note file:

The plain-text note by karbytes, dated 10 February 2024, explores profound philosophical and existential ideas. The author begins by recounting an afternoon nap near a field, during which they experienced a dream-like state of disconnection from their body, prompting reflections on human consciousness and identity. karbytes ponders the human condition, feeling that despite biological similarities with other animals, humans possess an emergent property, possibly akin to software, transcending their physical form.

karbytes expresses a belief that their essence is not atomic but a virtual entity, without a specific location in the physical world, yet intricately connected to their physical body. This notion aligns with the concept of panpsychism, the idea that all phenomena, physical or virtual, are part of a single, omnipresent mind.

A significant aspect of karbytes' philosophical journey is captured in their website, Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, which delves into these ontological beliefs. The author also hypothesizes about the nature of existence, suggesting that their consciousness could persist indefinitely without a physical body. This idea is rooted in the belief that reality is a boundless consciousness field, allowing for the possibility of violating physical, logical, or cultural laws.

karbytes contemplates the meticulous design of the geese in the field, imagining that these creatures could be part of a universe simulation created by a human-like entity. This leads to a speculation that the author's current existence might be a digital clone or a new mind within this simulated reality.

The note concludes with the author's intention to share these philosophical musings in a journal entry on their blogging website, Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. These reflections represent karbytes' exploration of the nature of reality, consciousness, and the human experience.
