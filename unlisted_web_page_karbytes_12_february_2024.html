Although I said in the journal entry web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_06_february_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes_06_february_2024</a> on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (which I shared to my social media profiles) that I would be taking a hiatus for approximately two weeks from making any updates to either to (a) the public karbytes-created website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> or else to (b) the public karbytes-created website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a> or else to (c) any public karbytes-created GitHub repositories which are partitioned under the portion of GitHub dot Com which is allocated to the user account whose username is <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karlinarayberinger</a> (starting at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_FEBRUARY_2024 and ending at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_FEBRUARY_2024), I decided within that time period to make updates to each of those three (<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surface</a>) World Wide Web partitions (which collectively constitute the entire <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyberspace</a> domain in which the body of public domain intellectual property named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a> resides and is intended by its author (i.e. karbytes) to permanently reside)).

Within the past 24 hours of the time at which <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_8/main/karbytes_12_february_2024.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this note</a> was being written (at approximately 1:45AM Pacific Standard Time on 12_FEBRUARY_2024), I (i.e. karbytes) created a streamlined and AI-checked web page on my blogging website which enumerates every file which comprises the aforementioned body of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public domain</a> intellectual property named karbytes and which neatly fits onto two M_DISC compact discs (and each of those discs has a storage capacity of approximately 4.7 gigabytes). The URL to that web page is as follows: 

<a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_23_february_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_23_february_2024/</a>

Rather than attempt to go on a multi-week hiatus in which I make zero updates to the aforementioned body of public domain intellectual property named karbytes, I decided instead to allow myself the liberty to make updates to that body of intellectual property as often as I deem appropriate and in service to my personal goals.

<span style="background:#ffff00">In general, I intend to make updates to that body of intellectual property no more often than five times per day and no less often than once per year.</span>

Finally, I intend to store the entire collection of digital files which comprises that body of intellectual property on M_DISC compact discs and/or other non-<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatile</a> long-term storage media (and I implore sufficiently intelligent information processing agents such as humanoids and sentient robots to preserve that collection of digital files for an indefinitely long period of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/count_down_timer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time</a> (whose temporal length always approaches <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infinity</a>) by periodically transcribing that entire collection of digital files onto new non-volatile long-term storage devices as often as deemed necessary by such information processing agents to preserve multiple backups (and preferably at least one million simultaneously-occurring copies of that entire collection of digital files named karbytes).

<span style="background:#00ffff">As a proponent of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychism</a> and of software development, karbytes has found it useful to assume that literally every phenomenon which has ever been observed or imagined has always existed without a "spawn point" nor a "disappearance point" from the perspective of an all-encompassing <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse</a>). Therefore, somewhere within the all-encompassing multiverse which is nature, karbytes assumes there unconditionally exists karbytes' cherished collection of digital files named karbytes (i.e. the source code and media files which constitute the public karbytes-created websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).</span>
