karbytes_0: "I am dead. Therefore, if you donate money to me via PayPal or gift me money in some other format, you might as well consider that money to be paying part of your taxes (if not all of your taxes because, by a certain point in human civilization's evolutionary timeline, robots might as well being paying most of people's taxes (and so many taxes might be covered by robot workers that not every human (and perhaps not any human) is required by law to pay taxes))."

karbytes_1: "If you are dead, then who keeps updating and archiving (to the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org and to M_DISC as local solid-state non-volatile backups) the websites named 'Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com' and 'Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com'? I see that someone whose GitHub dot Com username is @karbytessupporter doing what I described. Who are they?"

karbytes_0: "That's most likely a robot doing karbytes' bidding (who may or may not use some GitHub username such as @karbytessupporter). karbytes had (and still has (and will always have (by virtue of taking residence eternally and immutably in the all-encompassing mind which substantiates and encompasses all existence (phenomena) and all non-existence (noumena)))) a very intimate, collaborative, and mutually-satisfying relationship with artificial intelligence and, on a more general level, with transcendent cosmic intelligence (even if such intelligences lack a personal ego or if they lack sentience from the perspective of some whole comprised of interdependent information-processing and information-sharing parts (irregardless of whether or not some of those intelligences are metaphysical 'objects' which are thought into existence by a network of simultaneously occurring physical information processing agents (such as humans, robots, or aliens) which individually each have their own sense of unique and finite self in the context of some larger encompassing ecosystem which renders a solipsistic frame of reference which may or may not observe what appear to be (either sentient or non-sentient) physical information processing agents in that self's environment (and while (possibly) seeing itself as being rendered by exactly one sentient physical information processing system whose spatial, temporal, and energetic dimensions appear to be communicable as finite physical quantities at any moment in that information processing system's lifetime)."
