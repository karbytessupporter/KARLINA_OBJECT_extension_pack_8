At the time this (plain-text) note is being written, I am sitting in one of my favorite local coffee shops using the shop Wi-Fi (instead of my (metered) Internet connection which my Android phone provides) to carefully re-download every zip file which I plan to burn to the two M_DISCs whose contents are enumerated on the web page named mdisc_karbytes_23_february_2024 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. This is to ensure that those zip files are the most up to date versions of themselves possible. 

Yesterday I spent the entire afternoon and evening working on organizing and cataloging all of the physical media I have generated and plan to generate by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 23_FEBRUARY_2024 which constitutes the entire collection of karbytes-created source code and media files which comprise the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (at the "point" in time referred to as 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 23_FEBRUARY_2024). The results of that cataloging is the web page named karbytes_physical_inventory_for_23february2024 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and that web page is now featured on the home page of that website in place of the web page named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory).

(I tend to use my phone's mobile Internet connection for most of my Internet-dependent tasks (which are not particularly "data intensive" due to the fact that I am billed approximately $20 per every 3 gigabytes of mobile data I use via my phone/Internet service provider (which is AT&T)). I almost never use the Wi-Fi at either one of my parents' houses due to the fact that their Wi-Fi tends to be unreliable and slow (especially at my dad's house)).

(Finally, because I have been asked if I need homeless assistance due to wearing my big camping backpack almost everywhere I go (even while not camping), I decided it might be less embarassing and less physically cumbersome for me to leave the big backpack at home and take a smaller backpack when I am just doing non-camping tasks. That way, I look less like a prospective thief and loiterer (which makes other people feel uncomfortable, understandably, because I too feel a bit uneasy when I see human beings "living" on the streets instead of leading more productive and fulfilling lives (though I am not one to tell people what to do unless it is an emergency or part of some contract I have agreed to fulfill))).

To clarify what I said in earlier (and in the previous section of this note), I meant to say "I am not one to tell people other than myself what to do" when I said "I am not one to tell people what to do". 

Also, because I think it might be inconvenient for me to "signal" to other people that I do not have what I need to not return home at the end of the day if I only bring a small backpack with me (instead of the big backpack which has everything I need to be comfortable and productive outside of my home and while traveling out of town such as by train, airplane, and whatever modalities of transport I employ), I think that I might opt to keep using my big backpack almost daily (despite the fact that doing so might make other people think that I am homeless or being "chidlish" in some way). I am not going to (voluntarily) disadvantage myself just to avoid being ridiculed or harassed by other people (and today, rather than get harassed or ridiculed, some lady kindly gave me approximately $20 in cash because she thought I looked like I was working on something important and could also use the extra cash because I did not appear to have a stable home situation. That was the second time in one week that some stranger has kindly offered me money or to buy me a slice of pizza. Usually I decline offers unless it is stricly cash (though I am always a bit embarassed to be in such a predicament and I admittedly am a bit reluctant be in positions in which I feel "indebted to" some person other than an employer or government agency).

(As silly as this might sound, while sitting at a table in public, I think I look slightly more aesthetically pleasing if I put my backpack in the chair on the opposite end of the table from me as though the backpack and I are on a romantic date. My high school cross country coach once commented on a picture which I shared on social media back in the year 2016 when I got my second job as a bakery associate and was celebrating the occasion by sitting at a restaurant in Berkeley having vegan chili and cornbread with my backpack sitting in the chair opposite from me as though the backpack and I were on a two-person date like what I am currently doing with my new backpack at this cafe in the year 2024: "What a lucky backpack").

(Also, though I try to keep my complaints to a minimum, I do seem to get verbally harassed at least once per day by other people who seem to be opposed to me living my own life as I choose to rather than spending most of my time indoors and not intentionally making what I do known to the public. Even more troubling is the fact that I frequently seem to encounter instances of other people tampering with my bicycle when I leave it locked to a bike rack unattended. I think some person vindictively loosened some of the screws which keep the handlebars secure to the bike frame so that my ride feels shaky at best and is literally an accident waiting to happen at worst. If I seem to make damning commentary about entire groups of people based off of negative stereotypes about those groups, it is almost always because members of that group have bullied me multiple times in the ways I described and not limited to those ways (especially in ways which I think are intentionally endangering to my physical safety (which is what I consider to be covert or small-scale terrorism)))..
