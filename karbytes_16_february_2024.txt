At the time this (plain-text) note is being written, I am sitting in one of my favorite local coffee shops using the shop Wi-Fi (instead of my (metered) Internet connection which my Android phone provides) to carefully re-download every zip file which I plan to burn to the two M_DISCs whose contents are enumerated on the web page named mdisc_karbytes_23_february_2024 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. This is to ensure that those zip files are the most up to date versions of themselves possible. 

Yesterday I spent the entire afternoon and evening working on organizing and cataloging all of the physical media I have generated and plan to generate by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 23_FEBRUARY_2024 which constitutes the entire collection of karbytes-created source code and media files which comprise the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (at the "point" in time referred to as 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 23_FEBRUARY_2024). The results of that cataloging is the web page named karbytes_physical_inventory_for_23february2024 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (and that web page is now featured on the home page of that website in place of the web page named KARLINA_OBJECT_winter_2023_starter_pack_physical_artifacts_inventory).

(I tend to use my phone's mobile Internet connection for most of my Internet-dependent tasks (which are not particularly "data intensive" due to the fact that I am billed approximately $20 per every 3 gigabytes of mobile data I use via my phone/Internet service provider (which is AT&T)). I almost never use the Wi-Fi at either one of my parents' houses due to the fact that their Wi-Fi tends to be unreliable and slow (especially at my dad's house)).

(Finally, because I have been asked if I need homeless assistance due to wearing my big camping backpack almost everywhere I go (even while not camping), I decided it might be less embarassing and less physically cumbersome for me to leave the big backpack at home and take a smaller backpack when I am just doing non-camping tasks. That way, I look less like a prospective thief and loiterer (which makes other people feel uncomfortable, understandably, because I too feel a bit uneasy when I see human beings "living" on the streets instead of leading more productive and fulfilling lives (though I am not one to tell people what to do unless it is an emergency or part of some contract I have agreed to fulfill))).
