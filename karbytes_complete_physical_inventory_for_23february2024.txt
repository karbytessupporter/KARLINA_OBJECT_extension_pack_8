Between 11:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 15_FEBRUARY_2024 and 11:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 16_FEBRUARY_2024, karbytes took the following photographs of all of karbytes' physical inventory pertaining to the archiving of the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com:

(Any unused M_DISCs which are left over from any M_DISC orders which karbytes places after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 10_FEBRUARY_2024 will tentatively be placed inside of at least one of the containers which are used by karbytes to store karbytes M_DISCs and karbytes web page printouts for safekeeping until those blank M_DISCs are ready to be used to burn the next collection of karbytes data (i.e. any karbytes intellectual property which is published after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 23_FEBRUARY_2024)).

	- The photograph referred to as image_0 on this web page features a hand-drawn cover which karbytes made to place inside the front external transparent sleeve of a one-inch-thick three-ring binder which karbytes recently purchased for the purpose of storing karbytes media (and karbytes media which pertains to printouts of the PDF files named knowledge_14_february_2024_abridged.pdf and simulation_14_february_2024_abridged.pdf and to the two M_DISCs which are scheduled to be burned before 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 23_FEBRUARY_2024 named karbytes_23february2024_core and karbytes_23february2024_journals).

	- The photograph referred to as image_1 on this web page features the prospective contents of the aforementioned binder with the hand-drawn cover on it. The M_DISC inside of the clear plastic sleeve which is the page in that binder which is adjacent to the first page of the paper printout of the PDF file named knowledge_14_february_2024_abridged.pdf has since been removed from the binder due to the fact that the removed M_DISC is not part of the aforementioned collection of karbytes media which is intended by karbytes to be placed inside of that particular binder. The M_DISC was temporarily placed inside of that binder in order to illustrate what the contents of that binder are expected by karbytes to look like after the M_DISCs named karbytes_23february2024_core and karbytes_23february2024_journals are added to that binder.

	- The photograph referred to as image_2 on this web page features the aforementioned binder placed by itself inside of a metal safe (whose keys have since been lost or discarded by karbytes). That safe has been reserved by karbytes to store only what karbytes considers to be the most essential media pertaining to the public domain body of intellectual property named karbytes (and, in order for that collection of media to be considered "essential" rather than "preliminary" by karbytes, that collection of media must encompasses the entire collection of source code and media files which constitute the aforementioned websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).

	- The photograph referred to as image_3 on this web page features an (unplugged) microwave oven filled with all M_DISCs which karbytes burned within the past two years which are not part of the aforementioned binder whose designated location is the metal safe. That microwave oven includes the M_DISCs named karbytes_2023 (three discs with identical contents), karbytes_autumn_2023 (three discs with identical contents), karbytes_win2023 (three discs with identical contents), mdisc_karbytes_17_january_2024_disc_0, mdisc_karbytes_17_january_2024_disc_1, mdisc_karbytes_07_february_2024_disc_0, mdisc_karbytes_07_february_2024_disc_1, and mdisc_karbytes_07_february_2024_disc_2. That microwave oven also includes three-ringed portfolio folders which contain paper printouts of the PDF files named karlina_object_winter_2023_abridged_print_page_28.pdf, about_karbytes_winter_2023_abridged.pdf, multiverse_winter_2023_abridged.pdf, karlina_object_dot_wordpress_dot_com_home_page_winter_2023.pdf, and causality_winter_2023_abridged.pdf.

	- The photograph referred to as image_4 on this web page features two large green binders filled to the brim with paper sheets encased inside of clear plastic sheets and such that the binders are each partially covered by black plastic garbage bags and a large brown tarp. Those two binders collectively contain a paper printout of the PDF files named karlina_object_winter_2023_abridged_print_pages_0_to_17.pdf and karlina_object_winter_2023_abridged_print_pages_18_to_30.pdf. Those binders are strained beyond their capacity to remain closed. Hence, if those binders are opened, pages might fall out. Those binders have since been wrapped back up inside of their respective garbage bags and collectively wrapped up as one blob inside of the tarp and placed at the bottom of a large gray plastic storage bin in karbytes' room. Inside of that same gray plastic storage bin is the metal safe containing the smaller white binder (and that safe is on top of the larger green binders). 

(The aforementioned gray plastic storage bin is beneath another gray plastic storage bin in karbytes' room in the east-most corner. A clear plastic storage container is immediately adjacent to that stack of two gray plastic storage bins on the east side of that stack. On top of that clear plastic storage bin is the aforementioned microwave oven).

(Between 11:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 15_FEBRUARY_2024 and 11:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 16_FEBRUARY_2024, karbytes ordered an additional set of three M_DISCs so that karbytes would have enough M_DISCs to burn two copies of the set of M_DISCs named karbytes_23february2024_core and karbytes_23february2024_journals. One of those sets will be placed inside of the white binder while the other set will be hung on the west wall of karbytes' room in a similar fashion to how the three M_DISCs featured in the image (whose URL is displayed below) are arranged on that wall. karbytes plans on keeping those discs on the wall rather than taking them down or replacing them with different M_DISCs).
