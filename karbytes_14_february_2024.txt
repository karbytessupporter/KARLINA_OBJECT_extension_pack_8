I am strongly considering applying for citizenship in Switzerland as soon as I deem feasible and to move to that country to live and work for the next thirty years (if not longer).

This morning I had a vision of myself enjoying a scenic view of the mountainous wilderness from the vantage of my cozy one-person apartment while working remotely and enjoying a much higher standard of living than what what was available to me while living in the United States of America.

Rather than argue with humans (especially people living in the United States of America) about how that country and its authorities and celebrities "ought to" conduct themselves (especially in terms of inflicting punishment for perceived infractions) while that country, more or less, acts like a totalitarian anti-intellectual dictator trying to occupy the Middle East and other places where fossil fuels and other coveted material resources can be extracted for U.S.A. monopolies while neglecting the welfare of its own citizens (and while most of those citizens seem to do little more than indiscriminately breed and pollute and fight with other over (artificially) scarce resources and suppress intelligent discourse (for the sake of appeasing brutish and physically powerful chauvinist male apes who act like they own the place and corner and breed their female counterparts into being too weak and dumbed down to stand up to them)), I think I would waste far fewer of my resources and encounter far less endangerment to my physical and mental well-being if I join a country which is already well-established in implementing my values (which include things like "freedom of speech", "scientific and technological advancement", "egalitarianism", "computer literacy", and "environmental sustainability").

What compelled me to write this note was a thought which I had earlier this morning (and which I think is strongly related to the many videos I watched within the past three months of non-human animals fighting amongst each other in extremely violent and gruesome ways and otherwise behaving in ways which I think most (college-level educated "first world country" dwellers) would think is inhumane or prohibitively cruel for a human to do to another human): the idea that each human is only allowed to be as successful in terms of intellectual, economic, social, or athletic advancement as that person's community authorities are comfortable with. What that means (if that idea is objectively true) is that I am only allowed to be as smart, rich, socially connected, and physically strong as my neighbors are comfortable with (which means that I am not likely going to receive much in the way of encouragement to transcend the levels those people are generally at). Hence, perhaps the most significant factor as to why my public domain intellectual property empire (which is entirely encompassed by the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) is as good as it is and not any worse (in terms of informational comprehensiveness, orderliness, and aesthetics) is because, unlike most adult humans, I have been allowed to live with my parents for free while they issued me spending money to pay for most of my own expenses (excluding the things I paid for via money which I earned from working a W-2 job). If I did not have that socioeconomic "safety net", I think it would be a lot more likely that I would not even have a blog because I would be too busy working "overtime" for barely enough money by which to pay for all of my expenses and while being confined to "the ghetto" (which means I would be forced to disguise myself as a prostitute for thuggish heterosexual men or else as a thuggish heterosexual man).

I acknowledge that this journal entry (among other works I have authored) may be interpreted as hyperbole, parody, satire, or even "hate speech". Okay.

After taking the BART train and riding my bike out of the place I was hanging out at earlier today to the relatively spacious and professional place I am sitting at now I have had the opportunity to calm down and enjoy some hospitality after getting very agitated earlier by the incessant car horns honking and people saying rude things about me seemingly in order to ruin my focus and otherwise good mood (because such people apparently think I need to be prevented from being surrounded successful in my personal endeavors unless they exclusively amount to taking care of people other than myself and getting my basic survival needs met in exchange for being perpetually "on call" to attend to those people's whims as my "highest calling" even if that means forsaking my educational, vocational, and creative goals (especially that last item) in order to be that "human resource" other people feel entitled to having on reserve for their convenience at my expense (and "majority rules" in that situation which means that, because more people seem to want me "on reserve" instead of allowed to proceed with personal endeavors without being perpetually harassed, stalked, and set up to shortchanged than those who want me to be unencumbered by such bullying, I am on the "losing side" of the "battle" for karbytes to be self sovereign instead of in a hostage situation).

I might have exaggerated how severe the conditions encompassing my quest for autonomy are. I do not really feel encumbered in the way I described in the previous paragraphs of this note from the spatial and temporal vantage of where I am sitting now (at approximately 7:03PM Pacific Standard Time on 14_FEBRUARY_2024 (and at least twenty meters away from where other humans are shopping, dining, and commuting)). I am "afraid" that, as soon as I go back to where I was earlier today working on major website updates, I will be abruptly catapulted back into that engulfing and impatient to put me down "energy" which seems eager to swallow me whole, seep into my pores, and rot my mind and body from the inside out.

Of course I think I'm being a bit poetic and hyperbolic in this note. I also think I posited assumptions about human society and people which were inaccurate, overly simplistic, and possibly counterproductive at promoting peace, harmony, respectful communication, and meaningful collaboration between me and other humans. 

Finally, I want to reiterate that it is my intention to remain single and to spend most of my free time in solitude rather than to be more conventionally social. I feel that the World Wide Web and traveling locally and elsewhere provides me all the human interaction I want and need to be happy and sane. I cherish solitude orders of magnitude more than any interpersonal exchange or relationship I have ever had. My happiest and most profoundly meaningful moments were in solitude rather than in the company of other humans. That might not be the case with all other human individuals. I do think many humans besides me also prefer introversion to extroversion (but, in my opinion, society seems to strongly prefer and cater to extreme extroversion to the extent that it demonizes introversion, intellectualism, and solitude (especially while appreciating how things are part of an interdependent web whose intelligence transcends that which is merely human)).

The irritable honking of meat eaters, wife beaters, cat haters, and gas guzzlers still rages on even in this quasi refuge. It is extremely difficult for to find even a minute's respite from such an overbearing and patriarchal presence. Oh well. I'll just have to keep trying to assert my boundaries in a world which constantly threatens to obliterate them. At least I'm no longer acting subservient and/or spiritually dependent on some human other than myself. I think "committed relationships" are a socially acceptable form of mutual or one-sided enslavement and imprisonment. I'm ecstatically solitary and free to move and think as I please "beneath" (more like "inside of") the boundless sky in which Planet Earth is suspended like a mote of dust.
