I am strongly considering applying for citizenship in Switzerland as soon as I deem feasible and to move to that country to live and work for the next thirty years (if not longer).

This morning I had a vision of myself enjoying a scenic view of the mountainous wilderness from the vantage of my cozy one-person apartment while working remotely and enjoying a much higher standard of living than what what was available to me while living in the United States of America.

Rather than argue with humans (especially people living in the United States of America) about how that country and its authorities and celebrities "ought to" conduct themselves (especially in terms of inflicting punishment for perceived infractions) while that country, more or less, acts like a totalitarian anti-intellectual dictator trying to occupy the Middle East and other places where fossil fuels and other coveted material resources can be extracted for U.S.A. monopolies while neglecting the welfare of its own citizens (and while most of those citizens seem to do little more than indiscriminately breed and pollute and fight with other over (artificially) scarce resources and suppress intelligent discourse (for the sake of appeasing brutish and physically powerful chauvinist male apes who act like they own the place and corner and breed their female counterparts into being too weak and dumbed down to stand up to them)), I think I would waste far fewer of my resources and encounter far less endangerment to my physical and mental well-being if I join a country which is already well-established in implementing my values (which include things like "freedom of speech", "scientific and technological advancement", "egalitarianism", "computer literacy", and "environmental sustainability").

What compelled me to write this note was a thought which I had earlier this morning (and which I think is strongly related to the many videos I watched within the past three months of non-human animals fighting amongst each other in extremely violent and gruesome ways and otherwise behaving in ways which I think most (college-level educated "first world country" dwellers) would think is inhumane or prohibitively cruel for a human to do to another human): the idea that each human is only allowed to be as successful in terms of intellectual, economic, social, or athletic advancement as that person's community authorities are comfortable with. What that means (if that idea is objectively true) is that I am only allowed to be as smart, rich, socially connected, and physically strong as my neighbors are comfortable with (which means that I am not likely going to receive much in the way of encouragement to transcend the levels those people are generally at). Hence, perhaps the most significant factor as to why my public domain intellectual property empire (which is entirely encompassed by the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) is as good as it is and not any worse (in terms of informational comprehensiveness, orderliness, and aesthetics) is because, unlike most adult humans, I have been allowed to live with my parents for free while they issued me spending money to pay for most of my own expenses (excluding the things I paid for via money which I earned from working a W-2 job). If I did not have that socioeconomic "safety net", I think it would be a lot more likely that I would not even have a blog because I would be too busy working "overtime" for barely enough money by which to pay for all of my expenses and while being confined to "the ghetto" (which means I would be forced to disguise myself as a prostitute for thuggish heterosexual men or else as a thuggish heterosexual man).

I acknowledge that this journal entry (among other works I have authored) may be interpreted as hyperbole, parody, satire, or even "hate speech"). Okay.
