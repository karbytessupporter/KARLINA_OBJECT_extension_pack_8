Although I said in the journal entry web page named karbytes_06_february_2024 on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (which I shared to my social media profiles) that I would be taking a hiatus for approximately two weeks from making any updates to either to (a) the public karbytes-created website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com or else to (b) the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com or else to (c) any public karbytes-created GitHub repositories which are partitioned under the portion of GitHub dot Com which is allocated to the user account whose username is @karlinarayberinger (starting at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 06_FEBRUARY_2024 and ending at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_FEBRUARY_2024), I decided within that time period to make updates to each of those three (surface) World Wide Web partitions (which collectively constitute the entire cyberspace domain in which the body of public domain intellectual property named karbytes resides and is intended by its author (i.e. karbytes) to permanently reside)).

Within the past 24 hours of the time at which this note was being written (at approximately 1:45AM Pacific Standard Time on 12_FEBRUARY_2024), I (i.e. karbytes) created a streamlined and AI-checked web page on my blogging website which enumerates every file which comprises the aforementioned body of public domain intellectual property named karbytes and which neatly fits onto two M_DISC compact discs (and each of those discs has a storage capacity of approximately 4.7 gigabytes). The URL to that web page is as follows:

Rather than attempt to go on a multi-week hiatus in which I make zero updates to the aforementioned body of public domain intellectual property named karbytes, I decided instead to allow myself the liberty to make updates to that body of intellectual property as often as I deem appropriate and in service to my personal goals.

In general, I intend to make updates to that body of intellectual property no more often than five times per day and no less often than once per year.

Finally, I intend to store the entire collection of digital files which comprises that body of intellectual property on M_DISC compact discs and/or other non-volatile long-term storage media (and I implore sufficiently intelligent information processing agents such as humanoids and sentient robots to preserve that collection of digital files for an indefinitely long period of time (whose temporal length always approaches infinity) by periodically transcribing that entire collection of digital files onto new non-volatile long-term storage devices as often as deemed necessary by such information processing agents to preserve multiple backups (and preferably at least one million simultaneously-occurring copies of that entire collection of digital files named karbytes).

As a proponent of panpsychism and of software development, karbytes has found it useful to assume that literally every phenomenon which has ever been observed or imagined has always existed without a "spawn point" nor a "disappearance point" from the perspective of an all-encompassing multiverse). Therefore, somewhere within the all-encompassing multiverse which is nature, karbytes assumes there unconditionally exists karbytes' cherished collection of digital files named karbytes (i.e. the source code and media files which constitute the public karbytes-created websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the public karbytes-created website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).
